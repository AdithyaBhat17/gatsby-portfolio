title: "Let it Go!"

I am learning to love the sound of the feet walking from things that were not meant for me.  

Do not expect everyone to remain same over the time. Just like everything else in the world, people do change.  

We no longer live in a phase where people who are helpful,kind and real people are valued. What values most now is pleasing others by fake things,doing things for others just to please them.  

> We no longer live in the world where promises are kept intact. Promises are just made to break.  

    Do i need to change myself and try to impress others?
    NO  

No matter what you are going through, and how bad it is, no matter who has cheated you and broken promises, be kind, calm, and show Empathy.  

What is the possible other solutions you can think of?  

1. Take revenge by action/words.
2. Never help them with anything.
3. Take it personal.

Remember all the above actions will just hurt you and will never make any impact on others. The more angry you get, it’s bad to your mental health. Forget and forgive.  

Whatever has happened is over. Never ever go back to it. Karma will always play its part. Never be angry at someone for their decision.  

People do take their own decisions. You can not be judgemental about it. It is their life, they have made it. Let them bear the consequences. It should never affect you :)  

Be good to people no matter what you have gone through. The best thing in life is **EMPATHY**.  

You are your only competitor.  

Do good things, do not expect the same from others.Do good,be good,concentrate on yourself, which is more important.  

Trust me, activities like listening to music or physical activities like running/ playing any sport will always help one to relax their mind and free themselves from the troubles.  

Expectations kills . Never have it from others.  

Many a times, you are hurt by someone so much, how do you possibly deal with it?  

> Kill them with kindness.  

As the title says, Let it Go.  

No matter what it is, if it’s affecting your mental peace, let it go and set it free. If it has to come, it will find it’s ways to come back. Do not beg/ cry/ pray for that thing to happen.  

This is a simple thing which you will learn in a hard way.  

It took me ages to come here, hopefully it will help you come to peace. Feel free to talk to me, if you need something. :)  

## How we think affects everything from our ability to solve problems to how we understand meaning and value and purpose.
