Well, always remember your job description is always important than money. Always look to study and learn and never go behind company fame or salary.  

To start with the preparation for getting a job which you would like to, you need to clear the first step, which is quantitative aptitude (for most of the companies)  

RS Agarwal book and indiabix website are the one I suggest.  

I know it’s hard to prepare each and every part of the quant, so I will list the important one’s —  

* Profit and loss
* Time and distance
* Time and work
* Percentage
* Pipes (to lesser extent)
* Logarithms(only for AMCAT platform)
* Mixture (to lesser extent)  

This is how you clear the first round ☺  

Next comes the interview process. Every company has different set of interview questions, and how do you know what do they ask?  

Well I have a easy trick for it  

> Google “company name” glassdoor.  

Now In filter option  

> Set location to India  

And  

> Job title is job description which company provides.  

Prepare those questions which are given there and you will get the similar kind of questions for the interview.  

For the coding round which most of T1 will have, you need to get started from hackerearth, hackerrank or code chef.  

What about the aptitude questions asked in initial stage?  

Well I prefer these two apps —  

* Geek quiz
* Code monk  

These will help you to clear initial stage.  

I don’t remember whatever I had studied from beginning, do I need to study the textbook again?  

## NO  

Main thing is GeeksForGeeks.  

And if you are more interested in coding you can visit interviewbit.  

I guess I have covered most part of it, any doubt or more about platform details catch me up in Facebook — Shrinidhi Kulkarni
